                "description": "In order that test execution and results can be verified, only the following tools have been\napproved for use:\nTool Automated / Manual\nCSDA (Core Security Design Assessment)\nManual\nVeracode (SAST) Automated\nZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) (DAST)\nAutomated\nHP Web Inspect (DAST) Automated\n\n\nAlthough the configuration and use of the tools is not described here, accepted best-practice\nmethods and techniques should be used in order that tests are accurate, consistent and repeatable.\n\n\n 2.2 REQUIREMENTS\n * Security requirements for all initiatives will be determined by CSDA (Core Security Design\n Assessment) which are initially completed by the solution / security architect.\n * If SAST (Static Application Security Testing) or DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)\n are required, these will be delivered via engagement with $ADM Security - Engagement mailbox.\n * Security testing covers internal and industry standards such as ITEC, OWASP, SANS and PCI DSS.\n * Automated testing alone is not sufficient to validate all of the security controls required in\n CSDA. Manual testing may also be required for any controls which cannot be automated.\n * Penetration testing requires engagement with $ mailbox\n * Applications which have known security issues or existing waivers must be fixed and resolved\n within the agreed timescales of the waiver e.g. during warranty or prior to the next release.\n\n\n 2.3 ENVIRONMENT\nEarly security testing can take place in sandbox environments but should be performed on BR\nenvironments prior to go-live. Automated tools can be used and integrated as part of development /\nbuild.\nSIT / NFT BR environments will be used to scan code and ensure no critical or high security\nvulnerabilities are present prior to go live. For mobile initiatives, this will require engagement\nwith IT Security for penetration testing.\n\n\n 2.4 DEFINITION OF DONE\n * Security testing has completed when all requirements have been met using the toolset and\n environments outlined in sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3.\n * All Critical and High security vulnerabilities must be fixed before the application / changes\n go live.\n * Remediation plans must be provided and agreed for resolving any Medium security\n vulnerabilities\n * CSDA must be updated upon completion of security testing to evidence the final outcome and\n security position. Penetration testing sign off must be provided by IT Security if confirmed\n in scope.\n\n\n 2.5 QAE REPRESENTATIVE RESPONSIBILITES\nThe QAE representative has responsilibty to ensure security test principles detailed in Section 1\nare properly followed and met the requirements detailed in Section 2 using appropriate tools,\nenvironments and evidence.\nThey will also have accountability to ensure governance is followed if the definition of done has\nnot been achieved. For example, if any Critial or High vulnerabilities have not been fixed prior to\ngo live this will require consultation with ITBUCF security advisor and a formal waiver.\n\n\n\n 3. GUIDANCE\n * All initiatives or sprints need to be risk assessed for security requirements (standalone and\n BR)\n * Security testing should be carried out as early as possible to improve quality and reduce risk\n * Use automated tools to ensure common security issues are fixed during development\n * Use manual testing to identify vulnerabilities which cannot be uncovered using automated\n techniques\n * For evidence, the CSDA template needs to be updated and will be used for audit purposes\n * Detailed security reports will not be included in stakeholder deliverables due to sensitivity\n / confidentiality\n\n\n\n 4. DEPENDENCIES\nThe following dependencies must be met before this strategy can be fully implemented. It is expected\nthat these will be common across all themes.\n * DAST requires engagement with $ADM Security - Engagement team.\n * Penetration testing requires engagement with $IT Security - Project Penetration Testing team.\n * Access to route to live environments is required with unique user credentials and test data.\n * It has been agreed with senior management that whilst ZAP can be used for automated security\n testing in build, HP Web Inspect must also be used to ensure Low severity vulnerabilities are\n also identified.\n * Security defects need to be raised in ALM / JIRA and tracked to closure as part of each\n release.\n * Security standards and waivers are maintained by IT Security / ITBUCF and not QA.\n\n\n\n 5. APPROVAL LIST\nDate Approver Role Version Signature\n Andrew Baker Digital Head of QE\n Mark Ramsay Vulnerability Management & Testing\n Duncan Hurwood IT Cyber Security\n James Mitman IT Security\n Athanasio Kontonasios Digital Security"
